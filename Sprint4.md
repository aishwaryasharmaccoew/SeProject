# Things Completed 
## 1. Application Description

This is an e-commerce website for viewing and customizing swiss knifes as once purchased, swiss knives go a long way. It caters to customers like Bob/Nancy who fancy a highly customised product which they can create by picking and choosing from feature the available set.

Our application enables the same as Bob/Nancy can see the whole range of customizable products after they are able to successfully login.
If Bob/Nancy have not shopped with us before, they can signup using the register functionality.
They can also search for a particular product they already have in mind cause they are super picky :).
Finally they can proceed to pick/customise their product and add it to their cart. 
Once they are done shopping, they can logout successfully and hopefully return to shop with us.
